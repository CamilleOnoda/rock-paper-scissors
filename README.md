<p>A very simple implementation of the game:</p>
<ol>
<li>The user is prompted to choose between rock, paper or scissors and the 
computerâ€™s choice is generated randomly.</li>
<li>The game starts: if there is a tie, no point is given and the game continues.</li>
<li>At every turn, a message is logged to the console, indicating who is the 
winner of this round and what was used by the player and the computer: 
rock, paper or scissors.</li>
<li>Before another game begins, the current score of the player and the computer is logged to the console.</li>
<li>The first to reach 5 points wins the game.</li>
</ol>
